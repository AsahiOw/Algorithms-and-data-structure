Manhattan Distance Check (canReachEnd):

Calculates if it's mathematically possible to reach the end position with remaining moves
Uses Manhattan distance (|x2-x1| + |y2-y1|) to check minimum required moves
If we can't reach the end in time, we can abandon this path immediately


Trapped Position Check (isTrapped):

Checks if the current position has no valid moves available
If all adjacent cells are either visited or outside the grid, we're trapped
No point continuing down this path as we can't complete the journey


Unreachable Region Detection (hasUnreachableRegion):

Checks if we've created isolated unvisited cells
If any unvisited cell has no unvisited neighbors, it's unreachable
This condition catches cases where we've split the remaining unvisited cells into disconnected regions


Path to End Check (isEndUnreachable):

Uses flood fill to verify we can still reach the end position
If our current path has cut off access to the end cell, we can abandon this path
This is particularly effective in later stages of the path
